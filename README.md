# zlFetch

zlFetch is a wrapper around fetch that provides you with a convenient way to make requests.

It's features are as follows:

- [Use the response right away](#quick-start) without using `response.json()`, or `response.text()`
- [Get everything you need](#contains-all-data-about-the-response) about your response — headers, body, statuses, and more.
- [Debug your request](#debugging-the-request) without looking at the Network panel
- Shorthand for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods
- [Generates query strings automatically](#automatic-generation-of-query-strings) so you don't have to mess with query parameters.
- Sets [`Content-Type` is set to `application/json` by default](#automatic-content-type-generation-and-body-formatting). Override the `Content-Type` header anytime you need to
- [Body is converted into JSON automatically](#automatic-content-type-generation-and-body-formatting) when Content Type is `application/json`
- [Body is converted into form data automatically](#automatic-content-type-generation-and-body-formatting) when Content Type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- [Authorization headers (both basic and bearer) are generated automatically ](#automatic-authorization-header-generation) with an `auth` property.
- [Promise-like error handling](#error-handling) — all 400 and 500 errors are directed into the `catch` block automatically.
- [Easy error handling when using `await`](#error-handling) — errors can be returned so you don't have to write a `try/catch` block.

Note: From `v4.0.0` onwards, zlFetch is a ESM library. It cannot be used with CommonJS anymore.

## Installing zlFetch

You can install zlFetch through npm:

```bash
# Installing through npm
npm install zl-fetch --save
```

Then you can use it by importing it in your JavaScript file. It works for both browsers and Node.

```js
import zlFetch from 'zl-fetch'
```

Using `zlFetch` without `npm`:

You can use `zlFetch` without `npm` by importing it directly to your HTML file. To do this, you first need to set your `script`'s type to `module`, then import `zlFetch` from a CDN jsdelivr.

```html
<script type="module">
  import zlFetch from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/zl-fetch@4.0.1/src/index.js'
</script>
```

## Quick Start

You can use zlFetch just like a normal `fetch` function. The only difference is you don't have to write a `response.json` or `response.text` method anymore!

zlFetch handles it for you automatically so you can go straight to using your response.

```js
zlFetch('url')
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(error => console.log(error))
```

### Contains all data about the response

zlFetch sends you all the data you need in the `response` object. This includes the following:

- `headers`: response headers
- `body`: response body
- `status`: response status
- `statusText`: response status text
- `response`: original response from Fetch

### Debugging the request

New in `v4.0.0`: You can debug the request object by adding a `debug` option. This will reveal a `debug` object that contains the request being constructed.

- url
- method
- headers
- body

```js
zlFetch('url', { debug: true })
  .then({ debug } => console.log(debug))
```

Note: The `logRequestOptions` option is replaced by the `debug` object in `v4.0.0`. The `logRequestOptions` option is no longer available.

### Shorthand methods for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

zlFetch contains shorthand methods for these common REST methods so you can use them quickly.

```js
zlFetch.get(/* some-url */)
zlFetch.post(/* some-url */)
zlFetch.put(/* some-url */)
zlFetch.patch(/* some-url */)
zlFetch.delete(/* some-url */)
```

## Features that help you write less code

### Automatic Generation of Query Strings

You can add `query` or `queries` as an option and zlFetch will create a query string for you automatically.:

```js
zlFetch('some-url', {
  queries: {
    param1: 'value1',
    param2: 'to encode',
  },
})

// The above request can be written in Fetch like this:
fetch('url?param1=value1&param2=to%20encode')
```

### Automatic Content-Type Generation and Body Formatting

zlFetch sets `Content-Type` to `application/json` for you automatically if your `method` is `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH`.

It will also help you `JSON.stringify` your body so you don't have to do it yourself.

```js
zlFetch.post('some-url', {
  body: { message: 'Good game' },
})

// The request above can be written in Fetch like this:
fetch('some-url', {
  method: 'post',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Good game' }),
})
```

You can manually set your `Content-Type` to other values and zlFetch will honour the value you set.

If you set `Content-Type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, zlFetch will automatically format your body to `x-www-form-urlencoded` for you.

```js
zlFetch.post('some-url', {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
  },
  body: { message: 'Good game' },
})

// The request above can be written in Fetch like this:
fetch('some-url', {
  method: 'post',
  body: 'message=Good+game',
})
```

### Automatic Authorization Header Generation

If you provide zlFetch with an `auth` property, it will generate an Authorization Header for you.

If you pass in a `string` (commonly for tokens) , it will generate a Bearer Auth.

```js
zlFetch('some-url', { auth: 'token12345' })

// The above request can be written in Fetch like this:
fetch('some-url', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer token12345` },
})
```

If you pass in an `object`, zlFetch will generate a Basic Auth for you.

```js
zlFetch('some-url', {
  auth: {
    username: 'username'
    password: '12345678'
  }
})

// The above request can be written in Fetch like this:
fetch('some-url', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Basic ${btoa('username:12345678')}` }
});
```

## Error Handling

zlFetch directs all 400 and 500 errors to the `catch` method. Errors contain the same information as a response.

- `headers`: response headers
- `body`: response body
- `status`: response status
- `statusText`: response status text
- `response`: original response from fetch

This makes is zlFetch super easy to use with promises.

```js
zlFetch('some-url').catch(error => {
  /* Handle error */
})

// The above request can be written in Fetch like this:
fetch('some-url')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      Promise.reject(response.json)
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    /* Handle error */
  })
```

zlFetch also gives you the option to pass all errors into an `errors` object instead of handling them in `catch`. This option is very much preferred when you don't your errors to be passed into a catch method. (Very useful when used in servers).

```js
const { response, error } = await zlFetch('some-url')
```

`zlFetch` changes the response and error objects. In zlFetch, `response` and `error` objects both include these five properties:

1. `headers`: response headers
2. `body`: response body
3. `status`: response status
4. `statusText`: response status text
5. `response`: original response from fetch

```js
zlFetch('url')
  .then(response => {
    const headers = response.headers
    const body = response.body
  })
  .catch(error => {
    const headers = error.headers
    const body = error.body
    const status = error.status
  })
```

## Handling other Response Types

zlFetch only supports `json`,`blob`, and `text` response types at this point. (PRs welcome if you want to help zlFetch handle more response types!).

If you want to handle a response not supported by zlFetch, you can pass `customResponseParser: true` into the options. This returns the response from a normal Fetch request without any additional treatments from zlFetch. You can then use `response.json()` or other methods as you deem fit.

```js
const response = await zlFetch('url', {
  customResponseParser: true,
})
const data = await response.arrayBuffer()
```

## Creating a zlFetch instance

This feature is super useful if you are going to send requests with the similar options url or options.

```js
import { createZLFetch } from 'zl-fetch'

// Creating the instance
const api = zlFetch(baseUrl, options)

// Using the created instance
const response = api.post('/resource', {
  body: {
    message: 'Hello',
  },
})
```

A few notes here:

- `baseURL` will be prepended to the `url` for all requests made with the instance.
- `options` will be merged with the options passed into request. The request options will override the instance options.
